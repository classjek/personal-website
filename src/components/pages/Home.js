          I'm an undergraduate student at UCLA studying Computational Mathematics. At school I am the VP of Projects for the Artificial
           Intelligence/Robotics Ethics Society(AIRES) and I recently joined the triathalon team. I want to build things that are accessible 
           and helpful.
